## Stages of Reading

1. Remember
2. Understand
3. Apply
4. Analyze
5. Evaluate
6. Create

- Maintain a balance between the *Consumption period* and the *Digestion period*.

## PACER System

Categorize everything you read into one of the following :-

1. **Procedural Information**
	- Any information that tells you how something should be executed.
	- Ex: medical procedures, coding, languages, etc.
	- ==Practice== thoroughly as soon as you consume it.
	- Do not consume if you do not have time to practice.
2. **Analogous Information**
	- Information that is related to something that you already have prior knowledge about.
	- Actively try to relate new information with prior knowledge.
	- After forming an analogy, examine how good it holds by ==critiquing== it- 
		- How are they similar?
		- How are they different?
		- In what situation does the analogy not make sense?
		- Is there a better analogy?
3. **Conceptual Information**
	- Information related to facts, theories, principles, applications, etc.
	- Use mapping to connect each fact and obtain a bigger picture.
4. **Evidence**
	- Information that helps make conceptual information more concrete.
	- Collect it and note it down somewhere.
	- Store and rehearse the info later.
5. **Reference**
	- All the nitty-gritty , specific information that does not change your understanding of conceptual information.
	- Ex: mathematical constant, programming syntax, etc.
	- Flashcards or a spaced-repetition strategy can be used if required.
	- Store and refer when required.

- Procedural info + Conceptual info = Problem solving
