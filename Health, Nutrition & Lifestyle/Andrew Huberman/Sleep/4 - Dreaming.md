- *Slow wave sleep* - the brain is metabolically active.
- Motor skill learning and detailed learning happens during slow wave sleep.
- The sleep ultradian rhythm begins with shallow sleep and slow wave sleep, followed by **REM** (***Rapid Eye Movement***) sleep, which occurs throughout the night.
- *Norepinephrine*, the molecule involved with movement and alertness, is absent during REM sleep.
- **Atonia** - paralysis during sleep.
- Deprivation from REM sleep makes us feel emotionally irritable.
- REM sleep is also associated with processing of spatial information. It eliminates odd associations and meanings that don't matter. It attaches emotions to experiences.
- **EMDR** (***Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing***) is a treatment that involves performing lateral eye movement while recollecting a traumatic experience. This lateral eye movement suppresses the amygdala (brain region associated with threats, fear, stress and anxiety).
- Limiting the variation in the amount of sleep is important for learning and performance. For every hour of variation, there could be around 17% reduction on performance.
- Drinking water before sleeping could help remember dreams.
- Alcohol disrupts sleep patterns.
- Theory of mind - a test to check for autism.

### ACTION POINTS

1. Performing lateral (side-to-side) eye movement while recollecting a traumatic memory can reduce the emotional load of the trauma and make the memory lose potency.
2. Try to sleep for the same amount of time every night.
3. Do not drink water before going to sleep.
4. Performing resistance exercise can increase the amount of slow wave sleep.
