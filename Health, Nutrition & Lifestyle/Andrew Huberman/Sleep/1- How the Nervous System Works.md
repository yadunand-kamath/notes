- **Neurons** - nerve cells
- **Synapse** - gaps between neurons
- *Electricity* is the language of nervous systems.
- Our brain is a map of our experiences.
- **Sensory receptor** is a key component of the nervous system.
- Perception allows us to make sense of any sensation by paying attention to it.
- **Reflexive action** is involuntary (*bottom-up processing*), while **Deliberate action** is voluntary (*top-down processing*).
- Neuromodulators bias the active/inactive state of certain neurons. Ex: dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine, etc.
- Thoughts can be both reflexive and deliberate.
- ==Our actions and behaviors create a record of our existence==.
- Central pattern generators - fire up a group of neurons reflexively to perform some action.
- Impulsivity is a lack of top-down control. Alcohol or injuries to the frontal lobe can cause this.
- Agitation and strain is the entry point to neuroplasticity. Neuromodulators control plasticity.
- Neuroplasticity does not occur during the action, but occurs during sleep and non-sleep deep rest.
- Autonomic nervous system is the transition between wakefulness and sleep.

### ACTION POINTS

1. Playing a tone in the background while learning a skill, and replaying the same tone during deep sleep can speed up the learning process.
2. A focused bout of learning should happen in a 90-minute cycle (*Ultradian Rhythm*) followed by a 20-minute **NSDR**(***Non-Sleep Deep Rest***) to accelerate neuroplasticity.
