- **Adenosine** - a molecule that builds up the longer we are awake. It creates a sleep drive.
- Caffeine blocks the sleepiness receptor, thus keeping us awake.
- When we wake up, our *adrenal glands* release the **cortisol** hormone which wakes our body up and increases alertness.
- **Melatonin** is a sleepiness hormone secreted by the *pineal gland*. It also suppresses the onset of puberty.
- When light falls into our eyes, the *retinal ganglion* cells send an electric signal to a central clock called *suprachiasmatic nucleus* that resides on top of the roof of the mouth.
- Sunlight during early sunrise is the best way to wake the body up, while sunlight during sunset is the best way to signal the end of the day to the body (*low solar angle sun*).
- ==Blue light is better during the day to wake the body, while red (very dim) and yellow lights are better during night to put the body to sleep. However, any bright light is bad during the night.==
- When light is flashed upon the eyelids (even when closed) early in the morning, it can reset the body clock to fall asleep earlier.
