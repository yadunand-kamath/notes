- Viewing red light during the day could be beneficial in repairing mitochondria in the photoreceptors (slows down aging of vision). *(More studies required)*
- Blue-blockers are unscientific.
- **Circadian dead zone** - no amount of light can affect circadian rhythm during afternoon.
- Different seasons can affect the hormones/mood due to difference in melatonin levels. Ex: depression during winter due to higher melatonin levels (lesser light).
- Melatonin is synthesized from serotonin.
- Recommended times for exercise: 1hr/3hrs/11hrs after waking.
- Shivering is an automatic response used to generate heat during cold. It can induce brown fat thermogenesis which can lead to fat loss.
- Cold exposure can reduce stress, increase metabolism. 
- Cold exposure in the morning can phase advance the body clock.
- ==Light and temperature are best in terms of changing circadian rhythm.==
- ==Fasted states are associated with alertness, while fed states are associated with relaxation.==
- Some research papers suggest that jetlag can shorten your life.
- Travelling east takes more years off your life than travelling west. This is because staying awake is easier than deliberately trying to fall asleep.
- **Temperature minimum** is the time at which body temperature is lowest. Usually, it is 60-90mins before wake-up time.
- **Circadian Dead Zone** - times during which nothing can change the circadian clock.
- Stress releases adrenaline to the hair follicles that activates peroxide groups that causes the hair to turn gray/white.

### ACTION POINTS

1. Use a stimulus (odor/sound/vibration) while learning and use it again during sleep for better memory retention.
2. Shivering in an ice bath can induce fat loss, while controlling the shiver can help reduce stress.
3. Eating high-carb meals can induce sleepiness, while low-carb meals can maintain alertness.
4. Get about 100,000 LUX of sunlight before 9AM.
5. View bright light within 4 hours after temperature minimum to phase advance the body clock.
