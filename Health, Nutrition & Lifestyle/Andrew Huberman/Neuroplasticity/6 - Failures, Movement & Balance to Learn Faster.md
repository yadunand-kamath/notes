#neuroplasticity 

- Brain & nervous system controls our behavior.
- Muscle memory does not exist. Such information is stored in neurons.
- **CPG** (***Central Pattern Generators***) generates repetitive patterns of movements. *Example*: breathing, walking, etc.
- *Lower motor neurons* - reside in the spinal cord that controls muscles. They are controlled by the brain stem.
- *Upper motor neurons* - reside in the motor cortex on top of the brain. They send signals for deliberate actions to lower motor neurons.
- ==The way to create plasticity is to create errors in how we perform things to signal the brain that something is wrong/different.==
- Types of plasticity:
	1. **Representational Plasticity** - internal representation of the outside world.
	2. **Adaptive Plasticity** - ability to change that representation.
- ==Incremental learning with small errors is essential.==
- Needing or wanting the plasticity (the incentive) determines how fast the plasticity occurs.
- Learn to attach dopamine to the process of making errors to accelerate plasticity.
- You have to be in a state of alertness, but calm.
- Disrupting the vestibular motor relationship (sensation of falling or close to falling / disorientation from gravity) can release neurochemicals in the brain that can improve plasticity.

### ACTION POINTS

1. Determine the '*why*' for making a change or learning something.
2. Push through the point of failure and frustration while learning new things.
3. Try to release neurochemicals by performing motor actions (inversions, handstands, etc.) that can get you excited and improve plasticity.
