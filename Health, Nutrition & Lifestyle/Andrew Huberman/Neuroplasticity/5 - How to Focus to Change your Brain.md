- **Neuroplasticity** - the brain and the nervous system's ability to change itself.
- Developmental neuroplasticity occurs from the time we are born until the age of 25.
- Fire together, wire together.
- **Neurogenesis** - process by which new neurons are formed in the brain.
- Kennard principle says it's better to have brain injuries early in life.
- We can't add new connections without removing something else.
- *Epinephrine* and *adrenaline* are chemically same. It is called epinephrine when it is produced in the brain, and called adrenaline when produced from adrenal glands.
- If acetylcholine is released from brain stem, acetylcholine is released from the nucleus basalis and epinephrine is released, we can change our brain.
- ==Mental focus follows visual focus==.
- Blinking resets our perspective of space and time.
- Neuroplasticity occurs during sleep.
- The key to plasticity is to engage alertness, focus, NSDR and deep sleep.

### ACTION POINTS

1. In order to increase alertness towards a task, ask yourself "what do I want to accomplish?" and "why do I want to accomplish this?".
2. Focus your eyes on a small point on an object, without blinking much, in order to gain visual focus.
