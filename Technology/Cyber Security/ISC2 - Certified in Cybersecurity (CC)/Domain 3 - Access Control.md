## Security Control

- A **Control** is a safeguard or countermeasure designed to preserve Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of data and reduce risks.

- **Access control** involves limiting what objects can be available to what subjects according to what rules. It is about granting the appropriate level of access to authorized personnel and processes and denying access to unauthorized functions or individual.
	1. Physical
	2. Technical/Logical
	3. Administrative

- **Subject** is any entity that requests access to assets. It can be a user, a process, a procedure, a client (or a server), a program, or a device such as an endpoint, workstation, smartphone or removable storage device with onboard firmware.

- **Object** is anything that a subject attempts to access. An object is a building, device, process, file, database, person, user, program, server, client, or other entity that responds to a request for service. Objects do not contain their own access control logic.

- Whereas a ==subject is active== in that it initiates a request for a service, an ==object is passive== in that it takes no action until called upon by a subject.

- An **Access Rule** is an instruction developed to allow or deny access to an object by comparing the validated identity of the subject to an **ACL** (***Access Control List***).

## Access Management

- **PAM** (***Privileged Access Management***) is based on the **principle of least privilege**, which means that each user is granted access to only the items they need and nothing further.
- **Separation of duties** - the scope of work is limited and users do not have access to information that does not concern them. No one person should control an entire high-risk transaction from start to finish.
- **MAC** (***Mandatory Access Control***) policy is one that is uniformly enforced across all subjects and objects within the boundary of an information system. With **DAC** (***Discretionary Access Control***), it is up to the object ownerâ€™s discretion.
