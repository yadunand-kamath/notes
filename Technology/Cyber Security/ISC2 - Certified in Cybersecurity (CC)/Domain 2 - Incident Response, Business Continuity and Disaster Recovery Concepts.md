## Incident Terminologies

- **Event** - Any observable occurrence in a network or a system.

- **Breach** - The loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or any similar occurrence where: a person other than an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses PII; or an authorized user accesses PII for other than an authorized purpose.

- **Incident** - An event that actually or potentially jeopardizes the CIA of an information system or the information.

- **Exploit** - A particular attack that exploits system vulnerabilities.

- **Threat** - Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations, assets, or individuals via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, and/or denial of service.

- **Intrusion** - A security event, or combination of events, that constitutes a deliberate security incident in which an intruder gains, or attempts to gain, access to a system or system resource without authorization.

- **Vulnerability** - Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source.

- **Zero Day** - A previously unknown system vulnerability with the potential of exploitation without risk of detection or prevention because it does not, in general, fit recognized patterns, signatures, or methods.

- Incident response planning is a subset of the greater discipline of **BCM** (***Business Continuity Management***).

- **BCP** (***Business Continuity Planning***) is the proactive development of procedures to restore business operations after a disaster or other significant disruption to the organization.

## Incident Response Plan

1. **Preparation**
	- Develop a policy
	- Identify assets and vulnerabilities
	- Train staff on incident response
	- Implement an incident response team
	- Identify roles and responsibilities
	- Plan coordination of communication
	
2. **Detection & Analysis**
	- Monitor all possible attack vectors
	- Analyze the incident using known data and threat intelligence
	- Prioritize incident response
	- Standardize incident documentation

3. **Containment**
	- Gather evidence
	- Choose an appropriate containment strategy
	- Identify the attacker
	- Isolate the attack

4. **Post-Incident Activity**
	- Identify evidences to be retained
	- Document lessons learned
	- Review all phases

- The intent of a **BCP** (***Business Continuity Plan***) is to sustain business operations while recovering from a significant disruption.
- **DRP** (***Disaster Recovery Planning***) steps in where **BC** (***Business Continuity***) leaves off.

### Responsibilities of **CIRTs** (***Computer Incident Response Team***) :-

- Determine the amount and scope of damage caused by the incident.
- Determine whether any confidential information was compromised during the incident.
- Implement any necessary recovery procedures to restore security and recover from incident-related damage.
- Supervise the implementation of any additional security measures necessary to improve security and prevent recurrence of the incident.
