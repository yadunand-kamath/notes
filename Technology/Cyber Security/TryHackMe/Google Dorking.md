## 01 - Crawlers

- Search Engines such as Google are huge indexers of content spread across the World Wide Web.
- Crawlers discover content through various means. 
- One being by pure discovery, where a URL is visited by the crawler and information regarding the content type of the website is returned to the search engine. 
- Another method crawlers use to discover content is by following any and all URLs found from previously crawled websites. Much like a virus in the sense that it will want to traverse/spread to everything it can.

## 02 - SEO

- **SEO** (***Search Engine Optimization***)
- Search engines will prioritize those domains that are easier to index.
- Factors affecting a website's prioritization:
	- How responsive your website is to the different browser types
	- How easy it is to crawl your website through the use of "Sitemaps"
	- What kind of keywords your website has

## 03 - Robots.txt

- This file is the first thing indexed by Crawlers when visiting a website.
- This file must be served at the root directory - specified by the webserver itself.
- The text file defines the permissions the "Crawler" has to the website.
- Robots.txt can specify what files and directories that we do or don't want to be indexed by the Crawler.
- Robots.txt works on a "blacklisting" basis. Essentially, unless told otherwise, the Crawler will index whatever it can find.

## 04 - Sitemaps

- **Sitemaps** are indicative resources that are helpful for crawlers, as they specify the necessary routes to find content on the domain.
- Sitemaps are XML formatted.
- Search engines have a lot of data to process. Resources like Sitemaps are extremely helpful for Crawlers as the necessary routes to content are already provided.
- The easier a website is to Crawl, the more optimized it is for the Search Engine.
