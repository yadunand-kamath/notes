### It will never stop.

- It's an infinite game.
- You have limited time.
- Write down the things you want to do; eliminate everything else. 
- Don't wait for things to happen.

### Don't get hurt.

- Drop the victim mentality.
- Drop the excuses.

### What's your slight edge?

- Are you in the top 1% of your field?
- What is stopping you from reaching that potential?
- Start with being the best in your organization -> industry -> country -> world
- Why are you valued?

### Daily Routine

- Track your daily routine.
- Eliminate things that don't make you better.

### Stop making decisions to please people.

### Find someone who calls out on your mediocrity

- Spend time with them once a while.
- Share your excuses for not getting stuff done and let them call it out.

### Go all in.

- The way you do anything, is the way you do everything.
