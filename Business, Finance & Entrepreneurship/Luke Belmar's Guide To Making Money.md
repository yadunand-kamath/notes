- You need to make enough money so that you can use your mind and mental energy to focus on other areas of your life.
- Business is the ability to transact between people/businesses.
- The Trifecta of Money for any endeavor:
	1. **High Demand**
		- *Trends* - fast money, short-term plays
		- *Narratives* - long-term plays
	2. **Be the Best**
		- *Fixed* - reliable, punctual, trustworthy, etc.
		- *Variable* - skills, knowledge, capital, etc.
	3. **Irreplaceable**
		- Double down on your strengths.
		- Maintain your reputation.
		- Cash reserves
		- Connections
- You get paid in proportion to the difficulty of the problems you solve.
- Start with trends to gain some initial cashflow. Then try to switch towards narratives.
- Avoid Self Sabotage:
	- Small Losses compound - fix them.
	- Grace
	- Embrace failures
	- Position yourself to win so that it becomes impossible to lose.
	- Don't lie to yourself. View yourself from the outside (as a 3rd person).
- Focus on the inputs (process) rather than the output (results).
- The Inputs:
	- You need to have a product, service, or goods to offer some *value*.
	- Who are your customers? What is your niche?
	- Be specific. Who? How? Where? What price?
	- Modify your inputs based on the outputs.
	- Focus on the Life Time Value (LTV) of the customer.
- Your business NEEDS an online presence. 
- What's the first impression on your business? Get feedback/reviews from customers.
- Focus on both organic and paid traffic.
- Be authentic. Train yourself to think with a positive mindset.
- You are in control of everything. You have to bear the consequences of your choices.
- Find a safety cushion (profitable side hustle) before quitting your job.
- People will doubt you and try to stop you or bring you down when you try something new. So have a defined purpose to focus on your goals and stay committed.
